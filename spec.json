    "Output": "* **Result**: Outputs the signal from the classify input but adds a `label` attribute with the correct classification of the `data`.\n* **Ready**: Outputs a signal that can be used to communicate with other services or parts of the same service that training for the block is completed.",
    "Description": "Similar to text classifier but with the added benefit that data can be loaded from elasticsearch or another database and sent in through a list of signals. All signals must be passed through the first list that goes through.",

    ],
    "Input": "* **training**: Takes in a single list of signals such that each signal has a `data` and a `target` attribute.\n* **classify**: Takes in signals that have at least a `data` attribute.",
